# Go-NetSpeed
A single file speedtest utility, allowing for a quick test of speed between a server system and clients on web browsers. _Generated with AI assistance for my own use._

## Usage
1. Run the server executable - allowing firewall access as needed
2. On client machines - test connections at http://SERVER:8080
